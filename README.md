# astro.ericcarlisle.com

This is an [Astro JS](https://astro.build/) implementation of [Eric Carlisle's Website](https://ericcarlisle.com). This is the forth implementation of the site, each using a different static site generator (SSG). Previous implementations used the following SSGs:

1. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
2. [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/)
3. [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)

The choice to move from one to another was a learning excercise and shouldn't be confused for specific preference. All of these SSGs are very strong choices for generation of static sites.
