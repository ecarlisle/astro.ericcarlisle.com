			<h3>Architectural Lead - Infobae migration</h3>
			<p><a href="https://www.infobae.com">Infobae.com</a> is one of Argentina's larget media news outlets. As Frontend Architect, I lead a migration of the site UI to use PageBuilder Fusion, Arc XP's React rendering engine. Combined with other stack and network optimizations, this resulted in:</p>

			<h3>Performance Optimization, Core Web Vitals</h3>
			<p>In 2021, Google's <a href="https://web.dev/vitals/">Core Web Vitals</a> introduced a paradigm shift in Search Engine Optimization. Metrics for website performance and User Experience had become a key factor in SEO strategy.</p>
			<p>At Arc XP I spearheaded research to align clients with new strategies, helping them to adapt and optimize for the Core Web Vitals changes. Client launches and deployments were paired with Core Web Vital audits to preserve and improve upon page ranking.</p>
			<p>This research also influenced Architecture of Arc XP PageBuilder Themes, allowing clients to use components optimized for Core Web Vitals.</p>

			<h3>Skill - Addressing Region Specific Needs</h3>
			<p>As a Solutions Architect at Arc XP I consulted clients in 5 continents. The insight I gained in doing so empowered me to offer solutions unique to specific regions. Examples include:</p>
			<ul class="square">
				<li><a href="https://gdpr.eu/">GDPR</a> legal requirements in European Union countries.</li>
				<li>Performance considerations for regions trending mostly "mostly-mobile" userbases.</li>
